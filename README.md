## Description
If you want to select a radiator for a given room heat load, then you strive for the heat output tables of the radiator manufacturer.
These contain the standard heat output of the radiator according to [DIN EN442](https://www.ikz.de/ikz-archiv/1997/22/9722044.php), based on the system temperatures of:

* Flow: 75 ° C
* Return: 65 ° C
* Air: 20 ° C

Advantageously, most manufacturers have their performance tables set to the most common system temperatures, e.g. 70/55 ° C or 55/45 ° C, converted at different room air temperatures. However, if other system temperatures are planned for the planned heating system, these must first be converted.

So here comes that app into play.

## Usage
* Input fields: When you change the values of the input fields the result gets calculated and printed in the DOM dynamically.

* More to come...

## ToDo
* Make a good readme and explain this stuff! Q( '.')==O
* Add some base functionality.
* Completely redesign the CSS of the app and give it a modern touch.
* Modify the description in the HTML.
